# 🚀 Mini Projects

A collection of small and medium-sized projects where I experiment with new technologies, frameworks, and concepts.
Each one is housed in its own repository, and this index serves as a central reference.

## 🤖 Bots & Automation

## 🔒 Security & Utilities

## 📇 CLI Tools

- [**Contact Keeper**](https://github.com/rootdrigo/contact_keeper) → Contact manager in Python (CLI), with JSON storage and Regex search.
- [**Pixclues - Reduced image generator**](https://github.com/rootdrigo/pixclues-generator) → transforms an image into a simplified representation using the colors obtained from random dots.

## 📖 Notes
🔹 Each project has its own **README**, source code, and usage examples.
🔹 The idea is to showcase technical diversity: **frontend, backend, AI, security, DevOps**.
🔹 Some projects are "toy projects," others are prototypes with a real-world focus.
